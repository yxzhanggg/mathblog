I"L<p>Machine learning is still nothing greater that Hash table. Most of the concepts are renamed from the classical concepts, which likes the result of commercial bidding, for example, the activation function is actually the system function, and hypothesis is the system response. And the name neural network is just connected function compositions, to say more rigorously, transformation network. So it is just a fancy technique which distorted some concepts in the classical mathematics. If you want establish your great building of mathematics, then do not touch machine learning first!</p>
